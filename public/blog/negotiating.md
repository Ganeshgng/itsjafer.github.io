I just wanted to start off and make it clear that there is nothing ground-breaking in this blog post; I didn't do anything new or special to negotiate -- this is just to share my personal experience negotiating the offers that I had and attempting to make the best of them!

### tl;dr:

1. I used Robinhood (~230k) to negotiate Google from ~155k to ~184k
1. I used Robinhood (~230k) and Google (~184k) to negotiate Microsoft from ~184k to ~220k
1. I used Microsoft (~220k) to negotiate Google from ~184k to ~199k
1. I accepted ?

### Personal Circumstances

Going into this search, I was almost entirely set on finding a job in Chicago or an opportunity that would allow me to stay in Chicago (through remote work). This was *the* driving factor in making my decision. For that reason, I was mostly set on *which* offer I was going to accept; however, I needed to use the other offers to maximize the value of the offer I was planning to accept.

### The initial offers on hand

#### Robinhood

Based out of Menlo Park, I was really sold on the company and the work they were doing (despite some image-ruining scandals in 2020). The interview process was long but *very* fast and the questions asked were pretty fair. Their offer was **non-negotiable**:

Base Salary: $135,000\
Equity: $175,000 vesting equally over 4 years\
Yearly Target Bonus: $13,500 (10% of base)\
Signing Bonus: $30,000\
Relocation Bonus: $5,500 (after-tax)

**Total Compensation Year 1: $227,750**

#### Microsoft

This offer was for the commerce+ecosystems business group and was based in Redmond, Washington. The interview process was a phone and 4 round final; all five of these had a strong behavioural component and around 20 minutes of solving straightforward leetcode easy level questions:

Base Salary: $112,500\
Equity: $120,000 vesting equally over 4 years\
Yearly Target Bonus: $11,250 (10% of base)\
Signing Bonus: $25,000\
Relocation Bonus: $5,500

**Total Compensation Year 1: $184,250**

#### Google

I interned at Google for a team in Sunnyvale, but for my conversion to full-time, I requested the Chicago office. This was the base Chicago offer:

Base Salary: $111,000\
Equity: $85,000 with 33% year 1, 33% year 2, 22% year 3, and 12% year 4.\
Yearly Target Bonus: $16,650 (15% of base)\
Signing Bonus: $0\
Relocation Bonus: $0

**Total Compensation Year 1: $155,700**

I was located within 50 miles of the office, so, at the time, I wasn't eligible for relocation.

### Location Adjustments

The cost of living in Chicago is remarkably cheaper than in Seattle or the Bay Area. Google, however, does not consider the cost of *living* when negotiating offers; rather, the compensation team considers the cost of *labour*. Take that as you will, but it translated as follows:

1. Chicago is 15% cheaper than HCOL areas (Bay Area, NYC, etc.).
2. Chicago is 5% cheaper than MCOL areas (Seattle, Boston, etc.)

Therefore, when sending Google offers from other locations, they would discount those offers by 15% or 5% accordingly and *then* match them.

### Round 1: Send Robinhood to Google

First, I sent my Robinhood offer to my recruiter at Google and asked her to forward it to the compensation team. They discounted the Robinhood offer by 15%, and then matched it:

<blockquote style="background: #f9f9f9;border-left: 10px solid #ccc;margin: 1.5em 10px;padding: 0.5em 10px;">
I want to let you know that I've negotiated with compensation using your RobinHood offer (since that is higher). The compensation team says "We’re matching the competing offer in region (Bay Area), and transferring over to the permanent location (Chicago) to take into consideration the Cost of Labor difference, and therefore under competing offer by 15% in Y1/2."

Base: $111,000 \
Bonus: 15.00% \
Equity: $119,000 \
Sign-on: $17,000 \
Total Comp Year 1: **$183,920**
</blockquote>

I was more than happy with this offer; when you take into account the cost of living in Chicago, this salary had far more buying power than the equivalent Bay Area or Seattle salaries:

### Round 2: Send Robinhood and Google to Microsoft

I was pretty happy with the Google offer as it was, but I wanted to see if I could increase Microsoft to a point where the 5% location discount would still be higher than the update Chicago Salary.

To do this, I had to get an L60 offer. I explictly asked my recruiter if this was possible and she let me know that I'll have to write an email that she'll be sending to the compensation team to make my case. This is what I wrote in the email:

<blockquote style="background: #f9f9f9;border-left: 10px solid #ccc;margin: 1.5em 10px;padding: 0.5em 10px;">
I’m writing this email to make my case for an increase in compensation and/or starting level as a new grad at Microsoft.
 
In terms of experience, I’ve done 7 internships during my undergrad:

- DevOps Engineer at Camis Inc. from May 2017 to August 2017
- Software Developer at Bank of Montreal from January 2018 to April 2018
- Mobile Developer at National Logistics Services from September 2018 to December 2018
- Data Science Intern at Vida Health from May 2019 to August 2019
- Software Engineer (Infrastructure) at Yelp from January 2020 to April 2020
- Software Development Engineer at Amazon (AWS) from September 2020 to December 2020
- Software Engineer at Google (Google Cloud) from May 2021 to August 2021
 
These internships have given me a breadth of experience in a variety of aspects of software development ranging from DevOps to Infrastructure to Cloud to Data Science that I feel makes me a strong candidate at Microsoft.
 
On top of this, I have several open source projects that are used by thousands of users:
- Jupyterlab-Sparkmonitor (https://github.com/itsjafer/jupyterlab-spark monitor) is a jupyterlab extension with over 5000 installs 
- Lever Resume Parser (https://github.com/itsjafer/resume-parser) has been used by over 20,000 unique users
- Schwab API is a python library I created to interact with Charles Schwab (https://github.com/itsjafer/schwab-api)
 
Finally, I currently have competing offers from Robinhood and Google. The details of those offers are attached in this email but can be summarized as:
 
Robinhood (Menlo Park): 230k first year TC\
Google (Chicago): 184k first year TC
</blockquote>

The result was an update Microsoft Offer at L60:

Base Salary: $121,000\
Equity: $130,000 vesting equally over 4 years\
Yearly Target Bonus: $12,100 (10% of base)\
Signing Bonus: $50,000\
Relocation Bonus: $5,500

**Total Compensation Year 1: $221,100**

Again, this was a fantastic offer and I was pleasantly surprised at how high these numbers were.

### Round 3: Send Google the updated Microsoft Offer

I wasn't sure if the increased Microsoft offer would result in any action from Google's compensation team, considering that the salary was objectively less than Robinhood. However, I didn't think there was any harm in sending the offer anyway.

Soon after, my recruiter told me that they compensation team *were* able to increase the offer:

<blockquote style="background: #f9f9f9;border-left: 10px solid #ccc;margin: 1.5em 10px;padding: 0.5em 10px;">

*Microsoft*

Please keep in mind that we’re taking into consideration the Cost of Labor difference between the two regions (Redmond vs Chicago), and therefore under the competing offer by 5% in Y1-Y2.

*RobinHood*

Our offer is now coming in at 87% of the RobinHood offer but taking into consideration the 15% cost of labor difference between Bay Area and Chicago our compensation team considers our offer 2% above RobinHood after 2 years. 
</blockquote>

The updated offer came out to:

Base Salary: $111,000\
Equity: $130,000 (33%/33%/22%/12%)\
Yearly Target Bonus: $16,650 (15% of base)\
Signing Bonus: $20,000\
Relocation Bonus: $8,400

**Total Compensation Year 1: $198,950**

Note that I was able to get the relocation bonus by choosing to relocate from my home near my University (in Waterloo, Ontario).

This was a fantastic offer, when taking into account cost of living, and the offers that I had in hand!
