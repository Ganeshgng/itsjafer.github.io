# My personal website

This branch has the source code for my personal website. The website is written in ReactJS using React Router.

## Loonie

Loonie is a financial dashboard built as an extension to my website that uses Plaid API to monitor personal finances. Visit it [here](https://itsjafer.com/#/loonie)

## TV Show Finder

The TV show finder is a predictive model I wrote to help me find shows that I might like. It hasn't been updated since about mid 2019 so it's missing shows from beyond that time. Visit it [here](https://itsjafer.com/#/show-predictor)

## Resume Parser

This resume parser sends your resume straight to Lever's API and displays the results so you can see how well your resume gets parsed. Visit it [here](https://itsjafer.com/#/parser)


## Deployment

The website will deploy everytime a push is made to the master branch using continuous inegration with Travis CI.
