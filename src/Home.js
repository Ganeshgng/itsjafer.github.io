        <h4>Hi there,</h4>
        <p>I'm a third-year student studying concurrently at the University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University working towards an <b>Honours Bachelor of Computer Science</b> and an <b>Honours Bachelor of Business Administration</b> respectively expecting to graduate in 2021 with a concentration in <b>finance</b> and a concentration in <b>software engineering</b>. On top of this, I plan to graduate with a minor in French.</p>
 
        <p>Upon graduation, I will have six internships of four months each under my belt.  Currently, I am working as a <b>Mobile Developer</b> at National Logistics Services during the Fall 2018 term. So far, I've worked as a <b>DevOps Engineer</b> at Camis inc. during the Summer 2017 term and a <b>Software Developer</b> at BMO Capital Markets during the Winter 2018 term.</p>

        <p>My legal name is <b>Syed Jafer Haider</b>. I am a <b>Canadian citizen</b>, having grown up in the Greater Toronto Area, as well as a <b>permanent resident of the United States</b>, willing to work anywhere in the world that will offer me a great learning experience and a chance to better myself and others.</p>

        <p>When I'm not coding, you'll find me eagerly awaiting the next season of Game of Thrones, rewatching The Office for the 10th time, trying a new shawarma place, or playing one of Rocket League, God of War, Fortnite, and FIFA. I <i>love</i> playing board games; my favourites right now are Coup and The Resistance. In the summer, I like to coach house-league soccer as a way to stay active and work on my leadership skills.</p>

        <p>I invite you to explore my website to learn more about my experience. Feel free to contact me at my email or any of my social media listed above!</p>
