        <p>
          My name is
          <b> Syed Jafer Haider</b>
          {' '}
          and I&apos;m a student studying concurrently at the University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University working towards an
          <b> Honours Bachelor of Computer Science</b>
          {' '}
          and an
          <b> Honours Bachelor of Business Administration</b>
          {' '}
          respectively.
        </p>

        <p>I&apos;ve one research assistantship and six internships under my belt including experience in DevOps, Capital Markets, Mobile, Data Science, Infrastructure, and AWS; <a href="/#/technical">check out my resume here</a>!</p>

        <p>
          Apart from all that, I&apos;m a big fan of board games, movies, and TV Shows (for real, I even have a
          <a href="/#/favourites"> list</a>
          ), I love a good shawarma, and I like to
          <a href="/repo"> write tweaks for jailbroken iPhones</a>
          {' '}
          on occasion.
