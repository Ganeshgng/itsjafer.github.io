        <h4>Hi there,</h4>

        <p>My name is <b>Syed Jafer Haider</b> and I'm a student studying concurrently at the University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University working towards an <b>Honours Bachelor of Computer Science</b> and an <b>Honours Bachelor of Business Administration</b> respectively. My expected graduation is in 2021.</p>
 
        <p>I am a <b>Canadian citizen</b> as well as a <b>permanent resident of the United States</b>, having grown up in the Greater Toronto Area and willing to work anywhere in the world that will offer me a great learning experience and a chance to better myself and others.</p>
        
        <p>I have completed one research assistantship and five internships. I've tried to explore a different discipline within Computer Science with every experience:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Software Engineer - Metrics Platform</b> Intern at Yelp (January 2020 - April 2020, 4 months)</li>
          <li><b>Research Assistant</b> at University of Waterloo (September 2019 - December 2019, 4 months)</li>
          <li><b>Software Engineer - Data Science</b> Intern at Vida Health (May 2019 - August 2019, 4 months)</li>
          <li><b>Mobile Developer</b> Part-time Intern at National Logistics Services (September 2018 - December 2018, 4 months)</li>
          <li><b>Software Developer</b> Intern at BMO Capital Markets (January 2018 - April 2018, 4 months)</li>
          <li><b>DevOps Engineer</b> Intern at Camis Inc. (May 2017 - August 2017, 4 months)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I am currently looking for internship opportunities for Fall 2020, Winter 2021, or Summer 2021.</p>
        
        <p>Apart from all that, I'm a big fan of board games, movies, and TV Shows (for real, I even have a <a href="/#/favourites">list</a>), I love a good shawarma, and I like to <a href="/repo">write tweaks for jailbroken iPhones</a> in my spare time.</p>

        <p>I invite you to explore my website to learn more about me. Feel free to get in touch with an email or on any of my social media listed above!</p>
