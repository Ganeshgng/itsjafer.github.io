## Problem Statement

Underlying issue: Want to keep rapid growth

Background: In 1999, companies were used to specializing in one European country whereas the EU was a heterogenous region. The United States on the other hand is already a very diverse region and so USA companies are used to dealing with hetereogenous regions.

| Distribution  | Direct in Canada, wholesaler in USA   | Direct salesforce everywhere      | Regional in California, Oregon |
| | | |

## Quantifying

We look at number of lifts sold per population. We can compare Canada vs USA numbers and make the assumption that we can make one similar to the other.

## Decision Matrix

1. Identify criteria
2. Weight each criteria
3. Score each alternative

|Criteria|Weight|A1|A2
|----|----|---|---|
A|5|1|2
B|4|2|2
Total||13|18

Therefore, based on this decision matrix, we can say that A2 is the best weighted option.

We should also consider minimum requirements for a criterion.

Also, an objective can be a decision criterion. If it's not measurable, we can break down the objective into specific criteria.

We can have multiple different measures; risk, profitablity. We also need to know use calculations to support these rankings.

## Recommendation(s)

### Expand business in USA with New York Office

**Recommendation**: Expand business in the USA by directly selling the product rather than through the distributor. We will open an office in New York to service six New England states with a salesforce that is experienced in industry knowledge.

**Decision Criteria**

* Reputation and quality will be maintained as they will service and manufcature their own equipment
* Unrealized potential from wholesaler's lack of push strategy for the hoist can be realized by setting up shop in New York to service a larger market
* Close to the states geographically so does not require direct investment in manufacturing facility and thus mitigating major financial risk

**SWOT**

* Capitalize on every strength as CAH maintains or increases control over operations in the USA
* Exchange rate beneficial for US consumers mitigating expensive weakness
* Lack of wholesaler influence means higher bargaining power and more control over distribution

**Target Market**

Specialty shops for wheel alignment because of personal selling and less overhead for approval process as well as capitalizing on the unique wheel alignment features.

### Direct investment in Europe

**Alternative – Direct Investment in Europe **

Direct investment, where CAH would establish a manufacturing facility and set up a management group to market the lift in Germany.

**Pros**: 

*  Full control over the company 
    * Firm’s reputation of designing and manufacturing a quality product will be maintained 
* Less trade barriers – free movement 
* Germany favoured for both market potential and investment site opportunities 
* Less competition in Europe 
  
**Cons**: 
* Pierre might not be familiar with the European local market – might prove difficult in the marketing of the product 
* High risk due to high initial costs
* Exchange rates may fluctuate
  
**Costs** (**estimates within 20% of actual costs):
* $250,000 for capital equipment 
* $200,000 in incremental costs to set * the plant up
* $1,000,000 in inventory and accounts * receivable 
* $80,000 annual building rent
